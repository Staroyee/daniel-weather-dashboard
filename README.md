# daniel-weather-dashboard

## Description
I was tasked to create a webpage that would take user input and display the current weather and 5 day weather forecast, whilst keeping a record of the search history.

I was motivated to undertake this task because I wished to gain a greater understanding of how to use JavaScript to call upon server-side API's, collect their available data, and display it on my webpage.

## Solve
The completion of this project provides the user with a functional weather app which they can enter the names of cities and be returned with a display of the current weather and 5 day weather forecast of that cities location. It also records search history and allows the user to click on each previous search to re-display the weather for that city.

The webpage is now deployed for use.

## I have learned:
* How to use JavaScript to call upon server-side-APIs.
* How to use JavaScript to access the data within the APIs.
* How to use JavaScript to display the data on my webpage.


## Installation

4. Use the git command `git clone` followed by the URL copied from Github to clone the repo to our machine.
5. The `git clone` command creates a new directory with the same name as the repository. We navigate into our new directory using `cd`.
6. The repository should now be cloned onto your device and able to be edited in VScode or another editing software.
